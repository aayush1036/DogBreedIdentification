We often see that many pet owners tend to abandon their dogs because they could not take care of them for some reasons, and these dogs are forcced to live in harsh conditions 

Our project aims to solve this problem by using deep learning. We have created a model which can predict 120 different breeds of dogs with upto 88% accuracy. We have created a web app connected to a database where the users can upload the photos of the abandoned dogs which they find along with the address where they found it. The model will then predict the breed of the dog and will make an entry in the database where the administrative body can monitor the database and help the dog to find a new home.
